      <h1 class="c3" id="h.mv6nblw2sk45"><span class="c5">Executive Summary</span></h1>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">This report serves to highlight the decisions made to come to our current prototype
              and future plans for CamConvert, our premier conversion mobile app. Intended to be used by anyone with
              minimal onboarding, we set out to solve common problems afflicting similar apps, such as an excess of clicks
              required to finish the intended task. Through extensive research into these prospective competitors, we
              identified these common problems, as well as brainstormed issues that can might come up with our design
              prototype. After an initial prototype, our design went through minimal changes from first ideation, leading
              into an in-depth heuristic evaluation through a third party. Through this evaluation, we discovered several
              minor issues, mostly cosmetic. With this information in hand, we quickly implemented the requested changes
              with our high fidelity prototype. Combining this with usability testing with several users running through
              common tasks, we developed a set of recommendations for the next iteration, and possibly release candidate.
              These iterative recommendations focused almost entirely on accessibility, such as font adjustment and colour
              settings. </span></p>
      <h1 class="c3 c12" id="h.pf93ic7sc7qf"><span class="c8"></span></h1>
      <h1 class="c3" id="h.pf93ic7sc7qf-1"><span class="c5">Introduction</span></h1>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">CamConvert is our premier app designed to bring the tedious task of unit conversion
              to a swift resolution. Built with most common conversions in mind, such as baking (ie. converting oz. to
              ml.) or temperatures, CamConvert is designed for all users. What sets the app apart from its competitors is
              the focus on ease of use and its camera utility. Getting into the app, getting the proper formula set up,
              and getting a finished conversion should be as fast as possible, with the fewest steps in between. Using the
              camera can expedite this even faster, by taking the entry of one measurement in your environment quickly,
              and converting on the same screen.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">We aim for this app to be available to our users whenever they need it. More often
              than not, in our daily lives, we don&rsquo;t expect to encounter unfamiliar measurements. This is especially
              true in Canada, where the relatively recent metrification of units has left us understanding some
              measurements better than others based on context (e.g. distance is almost always in kilometres, but most
              Canadians know their own height in feet and inches). As such, we intend for this to be a mobile app.</span>
      </p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span></p>
      <h1 class="c3" id="h.cecc5kou63e5"><span class="c5">Design Problem</span></h1>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Our primary design problem was twofold: how do we differentiate this app from the
              myriad of unit converters available for free or a small fee, and how do we make the process simple yet
              robust. </span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <h1 class="c3 c12" id="h.778irr9ri5bc"><span class="c8"></span></h1>
      <h1 class="c3" id="h.778irr9ri5bc-2"><span class="c5">User Research and Findings</span></h1>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">We decided our best course of action for research would be to brainstorm possible
              errors in our own design, as well as analyzing our potential competition for common and esoteric mistakes.
          </span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">We analyzed roughly ten different apps, with the majority being free. Common findings
              we found were that advertising and onboarding took up far too much screen real estate and time. Often we
              were bombarded by ads to buy a paid version or support the project. While free software does need revenue
              from something, we found that being too invasive was more damaging that helpful. </span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Another, possibly more egregious issue was that often categories for conversions and
              finding the measurements we needed was more complicated than needed. Menus or categories were unclear, and
              getting to the conversion screen was a chore. We resolved at this point that getting from opening to
              conversion should be as fast as possible. </span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lastly, through error analysis we found potential points of failure in our design.
              Unanimously we found that the camera would be the most likely source of issues in terms of errors, and so we
              designed the camera with this in mind. </span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">We also figured that having too compact of a design would create issues with
              selecting menu items, especially for people with reduced agility and mobility. We also found that not having
              enough control over the app could lead to cascading issues. </span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <h1 class="c3" id="h.ocskgwkq947q"><span class="c10">Design and Justification</span><span class="c9"><br><br>In
              finalizing our initial design, we settled on large icons to allow for easier navigation regardless of
              dexterity. We chose to organize all of our conversion options by broad categories, using recognizable
              pictures and common names. Through this design, it takes a total of two buttons to get straight to the task
              at hand, converting units. We chose to keep things rather minimalistic, counting on recognizability of
              standard icons and common sense rather than textually label our buttons and menus. Our camera utility was
              designed with ease of use in mind, with framing markers clearly denoting where a the camera must be
              centered, and doing the conversion on the same screen instead of requiring more actions to do. </span></h1>
      <h1 class="c3" id="h.u59fbypz8i7x"><span class="c5">Heuristic Evaluation and Findings</span></h1>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Heuristic evaluation was done by our peers following our first iteration of our high
              fidelity prototype. The issues can be summarized as follows:</span></p>
      <ul class="c7 lst-kix_92ejypo3l020-0 start">
          <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">The search button was identified as redundant, as the search bar was already
                  always visible.</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">The icons we used for Home and History did not match expectations.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">The camera utility felt out of place and not consistent with the rest of the
                  design.</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">There was no method of backing out of any particular screen aside from the
                  camera utility.</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">No discernable documentation or help menus.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h1 class="c3" id="h.u59fbypz8i7x-3"><span class="c5">User Testing and Findings</span></h1>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Usability testing was very useful, highlighting a few issues that we otherwise might
              never have thought of. Primarily, these issues were accessibility related. Users were able to easily
              complete all our tasks, which consisted of:</span></p>
      <ul class="c7 lst-kix_5vs8oho6dvcx-0 start">
          <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Logging in</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Selecting the desired conversion</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Swapping converted values</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Using the camera utility</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Selecting favourites and history.</span></li>
          <li class="c2 c4"><span class="c0">Returning to the &ldquo;Home&rdquo; screen.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">What we found was that the flow of our app was perfectly fine, however
              recognizability and consistency of our icons led to some issues. Several users didn&rsquo;t immediately
              connect the menu icon we chose with its intended purpose as a Home icon, as well as the History menu having
              the same issue. Further, there was some confusion as to whether an action had been completed, stemming from
              a lack of visual feedback indicating system status.</span></p>
      <p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of note is the colours and contrast of some of the menus and selectors was difficult
              for someone with sight impairment to read, as well as some of the fonts being too small.</span></p>
      <h1 class="c3" id="h.u59fbypz8i7x-4"><span class="c5">Recommendations for Next Iteration of Design</span></h1>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Recommendations for the next iteration are fairly simple and comprehensive. We will
              be adding accessibility options stemming from our usability testing. Specifically, we want to add font size
              adjusters, colour options to help with contrast and colour-blindness. We also will be adjusting icons for
              maximum consistency and recognizability, through common Android and Apple icons, as well as including visual
              cues to actions being completed, such as darkening a button when pressed. </span></p>
      <h1 class="c3" id="h.u59fbypz8i7x-5"><span class="c5">Conclusions</span></h1>
      <p class="c2"><span class="c0">We have a stable design with which to go forward and create a widely used product. We
              gathered an incredible amount of quality feedback from our peers, users and own trial and error with which
              to perfect our next iteration, and developed a quality understanding of common design methods throughout the
              development process. </span></p>
