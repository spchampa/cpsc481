      <h1 class="c10" id="h.bpi4kjzdwsds"><span class="c13">Project 1: Project Proposal and User Research</span></h1>
      <h2 class="c8" id="h.ej98huy55k0f"><span class="c9">Part 1A: Identify Project Idea</span></h2>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c3">Our project idea is a simple unit converter mobile app, supporting manual input to
          convert all basic units of measure for length, time, temperature, weight, etc., with additional
          functionality. Specifically, the user would also be able to take a photo with their phone camera, and our
          app would retrieve text from the photo as a string, use that string to identify the units used, and convert
          the units automatically. </span></p>
      <p class="c6 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c3">This system can be used in many contexts: for example, users may need to convert
          miles to kilometres on street signs while travelling, cups to fluid ounces in a recipe, inches to
          centimetres to check knitting gauge, and so on. For our users, we will place the most emphasis on those who
          may use it more frequently, such as home chefs, craft enthusiasts, frequent travellers, etc. However,
          ultimately, this system can be used by anyone, since we have all needed to convert some sort of measurement
          before in our lives.</span></p>
      <p class="c6 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c14">We aim for this app to be available to our users whenever they need it. More often
          than not, in our daily lives, we don&rsquo;t expect to encounter unfamiliar measurements. This is especially
          true in Canada, where the relatively recent metrification of units has left us understanding some
          measurements better than others based on context (e.g. distance is almost always in kilometres, but most
          Canadians know their own height in feet and inches). As such, we intend for this to be a mobile app. This
        </span><span>will allow our user base to have the application available to them for use at a moment&rsquo;s
          notice, since we now live in a society where smartphones are fairly ubiquitous.</span></p>
      <p class="c6 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p>
      <h2 class="c8" id="h.gkwbh2wpnuan"><span class="c9">Part 1B: Identify Stakeholders</span></h2>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c3">The primary stakeholders in this instance are the users of the app, however, that
          includes a broad range of people. For instance, an older person using the app to convert measurements for
          cooking may be unfamiliar with common app design standards, while a contractor or engineer who may need to
          make conversions frequently will desire flexibility to make conversions more efficiently or easily. As such,
          it is critical that our design be simple and easy to read, while incorporating intuitive and easy-to-use
          shortcuts or customizability.</span></p>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c3">Additionally, we acknowledge that there may be additional stakeholders who are not
          users, but may have reasons to be interested in our system. As such, we will consider three main stakeholder
          groups in our design:<br></span></p>
      <ul class="c2 lst-kix_vbex3gozbk1w-0 start">
        <li class="c1"><span class="c3">The older or more inexperienced user. This application could be very useful to
            older users, since it will have the capability to perform conversions automatically. Many older
            individuals are also hobbyists, so our application could appeal to them as well. For these users, it
            will be important to have a simple interface with clearly labelled UI elements and concise instructions
            where necessary, in order to foster a simple, hassle-free experience with our system.<br></span></li>
        <li class="c1"><span class="c3">The younger or more technologically-savvy user. This encompasses most of our
            target user base of crafters, contractors, bakers, and other hands-on individuals who are already
            interested in using technology for their projects. We will assume that these users will have some
            experience using mobile applications, particularly ones with camera functionality (e.g. Snapchat). As
            such, it will be important to create an aesthetically pleasing interface that accomplishes the task of
            unit conversion quickly for these users.<br></span></li>
        <li class="c1"><span class="c3">Other system developers. These could be developers of rival apps (see Secondary
            Research below), or developers of systems that would benefit from integrating unit conversion. For
            example, it may be useful for the developer of a recipes application to have a unit converter available.
            As such, we would need to be mindful of the fact that other developers may be looking at this system
            with the intent of developing a rival application, or even incorporating our system into their own
            application. We will assume that these individuals are highly skilled &amp; knowledgeable of system
            design already - as such, it will be important to conform to industry standards for mobile application
            design.</span></li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="c8" id="h.nlk1k289t0ee"><span class="c9">Part 2A: User Research - Secondary Research</span></h2>
      <h3 class="c4" id="h.crt73nm32tm1"><span class="c5">Justification of Method:</span></h3>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c3">Our team selected secondary research to determine what other similar solutions
          exist
          in an attempt to understand what users want from applications in this domain. We believe this method is a
          good choice because we can gain more useful information from the real marketplace, such as if a currently
          available application is successful, and if it has design flaws from self exploration of the application,
          and/or user comments about the application. We can also observe users interacting with those similar
          products, since we cannot demonstrate designs at this stage of our project for our own designs as we do not
          have a detailed design for our application yet. Additionally, we chose this method to determine what can
          realistically be implemented to inform our design choices by explicitly observing what can be done. As
          aforementioned, we wish for our application to conform to industry standards in order to cater to our third
          stakeholder group; thus, we are using this investigation method in order to capture ideas for what is being
          done well, or what can be done better. Furthermore, since this is not a research project, and we are
          implementing an existing technology, we believe learning from previous attempts to solve the problems
          associated with this domain is a good place to start. Finally, this methodology allows us to understand the
          design space in a market context to determine which features the users really want rather than relying on
          their advice or our own potentially flawed intuition. We believe this method will allow us to develop strong
          opinions of what design decisions should be made.</span></p>

      <h3 class="c4" id="h.1ydqzvi9ozkm"><span class="c5">Justification of Method:</span></h3>
      <p class="c6"><span class="c3">The application proposed by our group of a mobile device capable of viewing and
          interpreting numerical values and their associated units, then converting those units to another unit that
          is requested by the user, is a currently existing technology available in many applications on the market.
          While on the other hand, our design is not complete nor available for testing. Therefore, our proposed
          solution will need to improve upon the currently available solutions to compete in the market. &nbsp;And
          accordingly, our solution must be more user friendly and less prone to errors than other solutions to do so.
          &nbsp;In order to understand the ways similar applications are used, and misused, we should perform an error
          analysis of similar applications. &nbsp;Determining the shortcomings of other methods that are available to
          solve similar problems will provide us with design insights for our solution. Many of these insights may be
          related to user experience and user interface design. &nbsp;Through performing an error analysis of similar
          applications we hope to improve the usability of our design.</span></p>

        <li class="c1"><span class="c3">The application should maximize compatibility with Android devices.</span></li>
        <li class="c1"><span class="c3">The application should have a minimal disk, RAM, and CPU usage</span></li>
